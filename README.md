# Godotoid
BreakOut Style Game ported from Penjinoid by BZar (https://github.com/bzar/penjinoid)

I'm trying to get more cofortable with Godot engine again and this is a "practice" project to try and make a complete and functional game based on Penjinoid which was a example game created for my C++ Game Engine PenjinTwo (https://github.com/pokeparadox/PenjinTwo)
